# Web Audio Metronome

NM modified version that displays selectable cycle of 4ths or random notes on the first beat of the bar. Also has a mute button.

This application shows how to use a collaboration between a setTimeout scheduler and the Web Audio scheduler to properly implement rock-solid timing for audio applications.

Check it out, feel free to submit issues or requests, fork, submit pull requests, etc.
